				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<div class="column">
					<p>
						The languages we usually have represented 
						are Spanish, Korean, Mandarin, Danish, Lithuanian, Japanese, Korean, Japanese, French, and Arabic (with more to come). 
						All language levels are welcome, especially beginners! 
						This is also a great opportunity for non-native speakers to improve their English.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our members have spent time living in a number of countries around the world and have visited many more. A few hold Study Abroad Ambassador positions. So feel free to reach out if you have any questions related to study abroad, planning a trip, or need help finding a language study partner.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Questions?</b> Email us at LanguageandTravelSociety@gmail.com or reach out to us on fb @language&travelsocietydepaul

						<b>Our Purpose is two-fold:</b> 
						1) to facilitate language learning in a casual environment and 
						2) promote responsible travel so that one may have more meaningful experiences abroad. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Our main activity consists of <b>Bi-Weekly Language Exchange Meetings</b> that take place in a different place every quarter. This quarter we will be meeting over Zoom, however.
					<p>
						How it Works: 
						Participants start by checking-in. Each person then receives a name tag that displays 
						the language(s) they would like to focus on. We begin the meetings in English so that everyone can 
						understand each other. As participants join the event, we open up different language groups. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Officers: Rugile Kasperiunaite (President); Medinah Furqan (Vice President); Anna Wolf (Treasurer); Sarah Khan (Marketing)
